Lesson 3 Reflections

Question 1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer 1: I would use a remote repository when I'm working on something with someone else or when I know I want to use multiple computers to work on a project or even when I just want to keep a copy of what I'm working on, somewhere else, outside of my local device.


Question 2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Answer 2: It could bloat the repository with a lot of unnecessary commits or you may not want to always add your updates as commits to the remote repository because it's public and your changes might not be ready for primetime.
